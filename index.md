My most recent project involved developing a Password Strength Checker with Python. This was an exciting project for me, because it was the first solo project I completed outside of my Google Cybersecurity Certificate coursework. I was able to incorporate best practices for password policies, strengthen my understanding of regex, and test my coding capabilities with functions, conditionals, loops, and user input.
