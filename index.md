I am a dedicated career-changer transitioning into the world of Cybersecurity after 6 years in the education industry. I recently completed my training with Merit America, which involved 3 months of intensive professional development training, completion of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and several hands-on technical projects.
